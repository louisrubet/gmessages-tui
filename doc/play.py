"""Plays the demo scenario: runs PROGRAM in a pseudo-terminal inside this terminal, and types
the keys of the scenario into it once Space is pressed (or after --start-after seconds).

Everything else passes through both ways (output, keys, the terminal's replies), so images
show as the terminal draws them. Used by doc/record.sh; quits the program at the end.
